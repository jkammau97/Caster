# Caster

Due to me doing the metroid, I was allowed to borrow the parts for the caster. So I've only done the assembly on my own.

### Sub-Assembly

I just followed the instructions. Also I'm just gonna put it all in the same document so It's all in one place.

### Final Assembly

I did it! only thing I didn't know was to use ISO nuts and bolts and to use HEX thin nut grade A&B.
